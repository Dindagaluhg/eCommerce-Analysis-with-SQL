# Rakamin Mini Project
## Analyzing eCommerce Business Performance with SQL

### **Objective**
This project aims to analyze the business performance of an eCommerce company using several business metrics, namely customer growth, product quality, and payment type.

### **Tools Used**
- Dbeaver
- Jupyter Notebook

### **Results**
- The company experienced significant customer growth between 2016 and 2018.
- Increase in Annual Revenue.
- The number of canceled orders also rose every year.
- Consumer trends shifted from year to year, which can provide insights for future marketing strategies.

### **Recommendations**
- The company might want to prioritize customer retention and promote repeat orders, given they signify customer loyalty and can potentially amplify long-term revenue.
- The rise in order rate cancellations is not directly proportional to revenue growth. This indicates that despite a growth in cancellations, there may have been improvements in service efficiency or quality.
- From a strategic perspective, the company might consider enhancing promotions for lesser-used payment methods or roll out special incentives for the more popular payment methods.
